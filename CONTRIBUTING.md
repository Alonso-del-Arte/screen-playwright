I wanted to open this project to Hacktoberfest 2021, but I was just too busy 
with other stuff, and the same thing happened with Hacktoberfest 2022. Maybe 
Hacktoberfest 2023 will be the charm...

And now almost at the end of Hacktoberfest 2024, I still haven't been able to 
get this one into Hacktoberfest.

One thing I'm sure about is that pull requests asking for Maven will be rejected 
as spam. It's one thing to deal with Maven headaches at my day job, I don't also 
want to deal with Maven headaches on a personal project.
