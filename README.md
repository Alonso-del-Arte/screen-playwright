# Screen Playwright

WORK IN PROGRESS: A simple program for writing screenplays in the Cole-Hagg 
format. The file format will be open source.

The Cole-Hagg format for typing a screenplay is quite standard. But the format 
for storing it in a computer is not. Final Draft, Celtx, etc., they all have 
their own proprietary formats. Final Draft is the industry standard presumably 
only because the company that makes it made it first.

The most annoying thing, for me, however, is that they all seem to be online 
only. Which is just fine when my Internet connection is working. But when my 
Internet connection drops out, I wonder how a program like Celtx is better than 
an old electrical typewriter?

I liked an old version of Celtx. I installed it on my old computer and I used it 
almost right up to the day that computer broke down.

I want something like that. So I don't intend this program to have all the bells 
and whistles of a program intended to compete with Final Draft. I want this 
program to be simple and inobtrusive, and geared to someone who just wants to 
get a screenplay typed up properly and exported to HTML or PDF.

This program should *not* give screenwriting advice (e.g., to those who write 
screaming dialogue in all-caps instead of using a parenthetical), but it should 
keep you from silly mistakes like converting a whole paragraph into a character 
label (something that happened to me twice or thrice with Celtx).
