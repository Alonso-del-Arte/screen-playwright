# Screen Playwright

WORK IN PROGRESS: A simple program for writing screenplays in the Cole-Hagg 
format. The file format will be open source.

The Cole-Hagg format for typing a screenplay is quite standard. But the format 
for storing screenplays in a computer is not. Final Draft, Celtx, etc., they all 
have their own proprietary formats. Final Draft is the industry standard 
presumably only because the company that makes Final Draft was the first to make 
screenwriting software.

The most annoying thing, for me, however, is that they all seem to be online 
only now. Which is just fine when my Internet connection is working. But when my 
Internet connection drops out, I wonder how a program like Celtx is better than 
an old electrical typewriter?

I liked an old version of Celtx. I installed it on my old computer and I used it 
almost right up to the day that computer broke down.

I want something like the old version of Celtx, that I can use on my computer 
regardless of whether or not I have an Internet connection. So I don't intend 
this program to have all the bells and whistles of a program intended to compete 
with Final Draft.

I want this program to be simple and inobtrusive, and geared to someone who just 
wants to get a screenplay typed up properly and exported to HTML or PDF.

This program should *not* give screenwriting advice (e.g., to those who write 
screaming dialogue in all-caps instead of using a parenthetical), but it should 
keep you from making silly mistakes like converting a whole paragraph into a 
character label (something that happened to me twice or thrice with Celtx).

Character auto-complete complete might be helpful, but probably won't be 
included in the first proper release. However, it should also be easy to undo 
bad character labels.
